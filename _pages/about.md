I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Family Medicine at Case Western Reserve University. My research focuses on violence and emotional abuse in intimate relationships, as well as its consequences on health. I am licensed as Marriage and Family Therapist to practice and supervise other therapists in the State of Ohio. I have also worked extensively with survivors of domestic violence at the YWCA Domestic Violence Prevention Center in Indiana.  In the past few years, I have investigated various aspects of relationship conflictto model the interplay among various factors that underlie the complex dynamics of domestic violence. With this study, I earned an Outstanding Young Professional Award from the International Association for Marriage & Family Therapy. To translate the findings of my research on violence into clinical intervention, I developed a clinical intervention strategy to conduct therapy with couples in conflict. My current research program focuses on assessing the effectiveness of this strategy using neurophysiological markers of affect regulation and violence. In support of my efforts to extend my research into the neurophysiology of violence, I was recently awarded a KL2 training grant by CTSC Cleveland.
